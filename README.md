# homedir_conf
Home directory config

Download install.sh from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtheos/.homedir_conf/master/install.sh and run to install.
Install with `bash ./install.sh` and grant sudo if asked

Will symlink from ~/.xxx to ~/.homedir_conf/configs/.xxx so updates to the files are synced

TODO:
 - Make sua (update all) alias system independent
 - create periodic update check and prompt to update like oh-my-zsh (~cron?~check when sourcing)
